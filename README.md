# Deep Learning Lab
This workspace contains a series of exercises and projects related to machine learning and data science. The exercises are designed to help you understand the basics of machine learning, while the projects allow you to apply your knowledge to real-world problems.

## Exercises
The exercises are located in the **Excercises** directory. Each exercise is contained in its own subdirectory and includes a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) that contains the exercise instructions and code.

### To run an exercise:

1. Navigate to the exercise directory (e.g., Excercises/Excercise 1/).
2.  Open the Jupyter notebook (e.g., 01_ex.ipynb) in a Jupyter environment.
3. Run the cells in the notebook to complete the exercise.

## Projects
The projects are located in the Projects directory. Each project is contained in its own subdirectory and includes Python scripts (.py files) that implement the project.

### Projects Names
1. Project 1: Polynomial Regression with Gradient Descent
2. Project 2: Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks
3. Project 3: Language Models with LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks 

### To run a project:

1. Navigate to the project directory (e.g., `Projects/Project 1/`).
2. Run the main Python script (e.g., `harkeerat_sawhney.py`) using a Python interpreter.

Please note that some projects may require additional setup, such as installing dependencies or setting up a specific environment. Refer to the environment.txt file in the project directory for more information.
